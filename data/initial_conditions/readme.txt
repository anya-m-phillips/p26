# initial condition files:

*.npz : Stellar populations generated with cosmic

*.dat.10 : direct inputs to petar.init (positions, velocities, and masses of all particles arranged so that singles + binary centers of mass are in a King DF)

*.txt : text output from making the .npz or .dat.10 file of the same name (see scripts/gen_cosmic_pop.py and gen_king_clust.py)
